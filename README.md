# üçç Fruit Classifier CNN üß†

A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow & Keras to classify Amazonian fruits such as **A√ßa√≠, Cupua√ßu, Graviola, Guaran√°, Pupunha,** and **Tucum√£** from image data.

This project was created as a college assignment to demonstrate understanding of CNN fundamentals and model evaluation.
